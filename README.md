👨🏾‍💻 About Me :

Hi, I’m Anthony — a Cloud Security & SOC Analyst building secure, scalable environments across cloud and hybrid systems. This GitHub showcases my hands-on projects as I expand my skills in AWS, detection engineering, incident response, and infrastructure-as-code.

---

- ☁️ **Skilled in building AWS labs** using EC2, RDS PostgreSQL, CloudWatch, and Terraform to monitor user activity, detect threats, and trigger automated alerts in real time.

- 🔒 **Experienced in log analysis, alert correlation, and IAM security**, using tools like Wazuh, EventBridge, and SQL to identify suspicious behavior and support SOC investigations.

- 🛠️ **Automating cloud workflows** with Terraform and scripting to streamline monitoring, alert escalation, and response actions across cloud and on-prem environments.

- 🧠 **Always learning by doing**, with active lab projects focused on cloud incident response, security logging pipelines, GPO enforcement, PowerShell auditing, and threat emulation.
